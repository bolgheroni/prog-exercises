# Context: 
Media Compatibility

# Scenario:
You need to make an existing system with an HDMI port compatible with VGA ports and vice versa.

# Objective:
Use the adapter pattern to bridge the gap between different interface standards (HDMI and VGA).

# Exercise:
Implement adapters to allow HDMI-to-VGA and VGA-to-HDMI conversions.

# Desired Outcome:
- The system should support converting HDMI signals to VGA and VGA signals to HDMI.
- Users can connect devices with HDMI ports to devices with VGA ports using an adapter.
- Users can connect devices with VGA ports to devices with HDMI ports using an adapter.
- Ensure the adapters correctly translate the signals, maintaining the integrity and quality of the media being transmitted.
