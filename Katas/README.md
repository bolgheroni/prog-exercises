Folder for archiving my programming Kata Exercises.
here is a short description of a Kata, taken from the [codekata website](http://codekata.com/):

> *Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times,* 
> *making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long). Some involve* 
> *programming, and can be coded in many different ways. Some are open ended, and involve thinking about the issues behind programming.*
